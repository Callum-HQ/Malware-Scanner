In Python's logging module, log messages are categorized into different severity levels, which represent the importance or severity of the logged event. The severity levels, in increasing order of severity, are:

DEBUG: Detailed information, typically used for debugging purposes. These messages are generally used during development and are not typically logged in production systems.

INFO: Informational messages that provide status updates or progress of the application. These messages can be useful for tracking the flow of code execution and providing general information about the application's behavior.

WARNING: Warning messages that indicate potential issues or anomalies that may not necessarily cause errors but may require attention. These messages are typically used to alert about situations that might lead to problems in the future.

ERROR: Error messages that indicate that an error has occurred during the execution of the application. These messages are used to log critical errors that may impact the normal functioning of the application.

CRITICAL: Critical messages that indicate severe errors or failures that may cause the application to crash or stop functioning. These messages are used to log the most severe errors that require immediate attention.
